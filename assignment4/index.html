<p>Web browsers use languages like HTML and CSS to write instructions which are then translated by browsers and made into what we know as the internet</p>
<p>DOM- document object model- it is a process of determining how a page will be viewed</p>
<p>HTML, XHTML, and XML seem to be different more improved versions of eachother, they are all languages that are used by browsers to interperate and publish code into information the average human can understand. The differences are the simplicity of them and how they translate information, the requirements.</p>
<p>HTML requires document type, the root element, the head element, and the body element</p> 
<p>index html goes under assignment 4 in files, and it's for linking this page</p>
<p>you can only have one head, one body, and the head comes first always</p>
